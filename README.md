# Tic-Tac-Toe

Game created to [spec](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project) as first project for General Assembly Boston's Web Development Immersive program. See [requirements](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/blob/master/requirements.md) for more details.

## Basic features

- authentication (backed by a provided [Rails API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)): register, log in, change password, log out
- a clickable game board
- a button to start a new game
- a stats tracker that displays user's total wins, losses, and tied games
- something to display who won, once a game ends


## TODO

* Show a "game over" message
* Indicate whose turn it is 
* Deactive game board when game is not in progress (force user to click "new game" to get started)
* Deactive "new game" button when game is in progress 
* Documentation (see details in my [game-project-scope-study repo](https://github.com/rebekahheacock/game-project-scope-study/blob/response/study.md))

# Tic-Tac-Toe

Game created to [spec](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project) as first project for General Assembly Boston's Web Development Immersive program. 

## Basic features

- a form (or two separate forms) for registering a new account and logging in
- a clickable game board that you can use to play the game
- something to display who won, once a game ends
- a way to start a new game (e.g. a button, or a model window)

## TODO

* Basic project planning (see details in my [game-project-scope-study repo](https://github.com/rebekahheacock/game-project-scope-study/blob/response/study.md))
  * ~~Sketch some rough wireframes for how the front end will look and act.~~
  * ~~Write out some user stories for the app. User stories are short of how a user interacts with your app, and follows the format "As a <role>, I want to <do something>, so that <some goal>.~~
  * ~~Model the entities in your app. Draw a diagram. Use your wireframes and user stories to drive you modeling process by asking "What 'things' are a user interacting with?"~~
* ~~Create a repo that your project will use, and add a README to it.~~
* Create a simple front-end with HTML and CSS, and host the front end on GitHub Pages. Use your wireframes to guide your layout.
* Create the code to manage your game logic.
  * ~~auth: sign up, sign in, change password, log out~~
  * ~~create game board~~
  * ~~start a game~~
  * ~~play a game~~
  * prevent repeat moves

* Start communicating with the back-end using curl. Use this to begin writing your AJAX code.
* Add any additional features to your app.
* Finish your documentation. Make it high-quality.
